## TO-DO: 
* [ ] - copy components from original project, while cleaning them up 
    * [ ] - destinations-list.component -> FlightsList
        * [ ] - finish the weather function, try to get it to change which city it displays depending on which ticket is hovered over 
        * [ ] - google maps api was only added to meet project requirements for the final, but if i can get it to work that's cool too 
        * [ ] - i don't like the way the "Book a flight" changes to "Welcome, User!" everytime the page is refreshed, looks choppy, maybe add different cases for !user and loading? 
    * [ ] - App.js -> App.js
        * [ ] - possibly need to add routes later
        * [ ] - uncomment the SearchDestination and Footer components, and actually write them 
    * [ ] - footer.component.js -> Footer.js
        * [ ] - start writing (after routing/backend is working)
    * [ ] - search-destination.component.js -> SearchDestination.js
        * [ ] - start work 
    * [ ] - navbar.component.js -> Navbar.js
        * [ x ] - basic stuff is done, will need to come back later
        * [ ] - rename someone of the Links, idk if i like them
